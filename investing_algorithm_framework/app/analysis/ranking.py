    Utility to generate weights dicts for ranking backtests.

    This function does not assign weights to every possible performance
    metric. Instead, it focuses on a curated subset of commonly relevant
    ones (profitability, win rate, trade frequency, and risk-adjusted returns).
    The rationale is to avoid overfitting ranking logic to noisy or redundant
    statistics (e.g., monthly return breakdowns, best/worst trade), while
    keeping the weighting system simple and interpretable.
    Users who need fine-grained control can pass `custom_weights` to fully
    override defaults.

    Args:
        focus (BacktestEvaluationFocus | str | None): The focus for ranking.
        gain (float): Weight for total_net_gain (default only).
        win_rate (float): Weight for win_rate (default only).
        trades (float): Weight for number_of_trades (default only).
