| Metric             | High Value Means...         | Weakness if Used Alone              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Win Rate**       | Many trades are profitable  | Doesn't say how big wins/losses are |
| **Win/Loss Ratio** | Big wins relative to losses | Doesn’t say how *often* you win     |


Example of Non-Overlap:
Strategy A: 90% win rate, but average win is $1, average loss is $10 → not profitable.

Strategy B: 30% win rate, but average win is $300, average loss is $50 → highly profitable.

| Win Rate          | Win/Loss Ratio | Comment                            |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| High (>60%)       | <1             | Can still be profitable            |
| Moderate (40-60%) | \~1 or >1      | Ideal sweet spot                   |
| Low (<40%)        | >1             | Possible if big wins offset losses |


Practical Example:
* Win rate 40% with win/loss ratio 2: Good — you win less often but your
wins are twice as big.
* Win rate 60% with win/loss ratio 0.7: Also good — you win often
but your wins are smaller than losses.

What’s “good”?
* Typical win/loss ratio ranges from 0.5 to 3 depending on strategy style.
* Many profitable traders target win/loss ratio between 1.5 and 2.5.
* Very aggressive strategies might have a lower win rate but
higher win/loss ratio.
