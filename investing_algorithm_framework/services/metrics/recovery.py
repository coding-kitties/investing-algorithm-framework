🔍 What is Recovery Factor:
Recovery Factor =
🔹 Total Net Profit (how much you made overall)
➗
🔹 Max Drawdown (worst capital drop at any point)

This metric answers:

💡 "How much return did I get per unit of worst-case risk?"

🎯 Why this matters:
Even if a strategy has many small drawdowns, only the worst one is used.

A strategy that earns €100k total, but once dropped €50k from peak, has a
recovery factor of 2.0 — suggesting that it made 2x the worst pain it endured.

✅ Pros:
Simple and interpretable.

Useful when comparing strategies with very different drawdown profiles.

⚠️ Limitations:
It ignores the frequency or duration of drawdowns.

It can be misleading if net profit is inflated due to one lucky trend or
max drawdown happened early and was never tested again.

| **Recovery Factor** | **Interpretation**                                   | **Comments**                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 1.0**           | ❌ *Poor* – Risk outweighs reward                     | Losing more in drawdowns than you're making overall              |
| **1.0 – 1.5**       | ⚠️ *Weak* – Barely recovering from drawdowns         | Net profit is only slightly higher than worst drawdown           |
| **1.5 – 2.0**       | 🤔 *Moderate* – Acceptable, but not robust           | Strategy is viable but may lack strong risk-adjusted performance |
| **2.0 – 3.0**       | ✅ *Good* – Solid recovery from worst drawdowns       | Indicates decent resilience and profitability                    |
| **3.0 – 5.0**       | 🚀 *Very Good* – Strong risk-adjusted performance    | Shows good ability to recover and generate consistent profit     |
| **> 5.0**           | 🏆 *Excellent* – Exceptional recovery vs. risk taken | Often seen in highly optimized or low-volatility strategies      |
| **∞ (Infinity)**    | 💡 *No drawdown* – Unrealistic or incomplete data    | Can happen if drawdown is zero — investigate carefully           |
