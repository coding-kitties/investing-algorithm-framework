    """
    TradeTakeProfit represents a take profit strategy for a trade.

    Attributes:
        trade: Trade - the trade that the take profit is for
        take_profit: float - the take profit percentage
        trade_risk_type: TradeRiskType - the type of trade risk, either
            trailing or fixed
        percentage: float - the take profit percentage
        sell_percentage: float - the percentage of the trade to sell when the
            take profit is hit. Default is 100% of the trade.
            If the take profit percentage is lower than 100% a check
            must be made that the combined sell percentage of
            all take profits is less or equal than 100%.

    if trade_risk_type is fixed, the take profit price is
    calculated as follows:
        You buy a stock at $100.
        You set a 5% take profit, meaning you will sell if the price
            rises to $105.
        If the price rises to $120, the take profit triggers,
            and you exit with a $20 profit.
        But if the price keeps falling below $105, the take profit is not
            triggered.

    if trade_risk_type is trailing, the take profit price is
    calculated as follows:
        You buy a stock at $100.
        You set a 5% trailing take profit, the moment the price rises
            5% the initial take profit mark will be set. This means you
            will set the take_profit_price initially at none and
            only if the price hits $105, you will set the
            take_profit_price to $105.
        if the price drops below $105, the take profit is triggered.
        If the price rises to $120, the take profit adjusts to
        $114 (5% below $120).
        If the price falls to $114, the position is closed,
        securing a $14 profit.
        But if the price keeps rising to $150, the take profit
        moves up to $142.50.
