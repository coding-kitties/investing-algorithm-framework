    """
    TradeStopLoss represents a stop loss strategy for a trade.

    Attributes:
        trade: Trade - the trade that the take profit is for
        take_profit: float - the take profit percentage
        trade_risk_type: TradeRiskType - the type of trade risk, either
            trailing or fixed
        percentage: float - the stop loss percentage
        sell_percentage: float - the percentage of the trade to sell when the
            take profit is hit. Default is 100% of the trade. If the
            take profit percentage is lower than 100% a check must
            be made that the combined sell percentage of all
            take profits is less or equal than 100%.
        sell_amount: float - the amount to sell when the stop loss triggers
        sold_amount: float - the amount that has been sold
        high_water_mark: float - the highest price of the trade
        stop_loss_price: float - the price at which the stop loss triggers

    if trade_risk_type is fixed, the stop loss price is calculated as follows:
        You buy a stock at $100.
        You set a 5% stop loss, meaning you will sell if
            the price drops to $95.
        If the price rises to $120, the stop loss is not triggered.
        But if the price keeps falling to $95, the stop loss triggers,
            and you exit with a $5 loss.

    if trade_risk_type is trailing, the stop loss price is
    calculated as follows:
        You buy a stock at $100.
        You set a 5% trailing stop loss, meaning you will sell if
            the price drops 5% from its peak at $96
        If the price rises to $120, the stop loss adjusts
            to $114 (5% below $120).
        If the price falls to $114, the position is
            closed, securing a $14 profit.
        But if the price keeps rising to $150, the stop
            loss moves up to $142.50.
        If the price drops from $150 to $142.50, the stop
            loss triggers, and you exit with a $42.50 profit.
