    SQL Trade model

    A trade is a combination of a buy and sell order that has been opened or
    closed.

    A trade is considered opened when a buy order is executed and there is
    no corresponding sell order. A trade is considered closed when a sell
    order is executed and the amount of the sell order is equal or larger
    to the amount of the buy order.

    A single sell order can close multiple buy orders. Also, a single
    buy order can be closed by multiple sell orders.

    Attributes:
    * orders: str, the id of the buy order
    * target_symbol: str, the target symbol of the trade
    * trading_symbol: str, the trading symbol of the trade
    * closed_at: datetime, the datetime when the trade was closed
    * remaining: float, the remaining amount of the trade
    * net_gain: float, the net gain of the trade
    * last_reported_price: float, the last reported price of the trade
    * last_reported_price_datetime: datetime, the datetime when the last
        reported price was reported
    * high_water_mark: float, the high water mark of the trade
    * high_water_mark_datetime: datetime, the datetime when the high water
        mark was reported
    * created_at: datetime, the datetime when the trade was created
    * updated_at: datetime, the datetime when the trade was last updated
    * status: str, the status of the trade
    * stop_loss_percentage: float, the stop loss percentage of the trade
    * trailing_stop_loss_percentage: float, the trailing stop loss percentage
