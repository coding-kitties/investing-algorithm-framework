# Investing Algorithm Framework
The Investing Algorithm Framework is a python framework for building
investment algorithms. 
It encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

All the documentation can be found online at the [documentation webstie](https://investing-algorithm-framework.com)

In most cases, you'll probably never have to change code on this repo directly 
if you are building your algorithm/bot. But if you do, check out the 
contributing page at the website.

BEFORE YOU START USING MONEY WITH THE FRAMEWORK, MAKE SURE THAT YOU TESTED 
YOUR COMPONENTS THOROUGHLY. USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR INVESTMENT RESULTS.

Also, make sure that you read the source code of any plugin you use or
