# Investing Algorithm Framework

The Investing Algorithm Framework is a python framework to build investment algorithms. It encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design. It is free for personal usage.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to change code on this repo directly if you are building your algorithm/bot. But if you do, check out CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Disclaimer
If you use this framework for your investments, do not risk money which you are afraid to lose. We can't stress this
enough:

BEFORE YOU START USING MONEY WITH THE FRAMEWORK, MAKE SURE THAT YOU TESTED YOUR COMPONENTS THOROUGHLY. USE THE SOFTWARE AT
YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR INVESTMENT RESULTS.

Also, make sure that you read the source code of any plugin you use or implementation of an algorithm made with this
framework.
