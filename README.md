The Investing Algorithm Framework is a Python-based framework built to streamline the entire lifecycle of quantitative trading strategies from signal generation and backtesting to live deployment.
It offers a complete quantitative workflow, featuring two dedicated backtesting engines:

* A vectorized backtest engine for fast signal research and prototyping

* An event-based backtest engine for realistic and accurate strategy evaluation

The framework supports live trading across multiple exchanges and offers flexible deployment options, including Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.
Designed for extensibility, it allows you to integrate custom strategies, data providers, and order executors, enabling support for any exchange or broker.
It natively supports multiple data formats, including OHLCV, ticker, and custom datasets with seamless compatibility for both Pandas and Polars DataFrames.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Installation
Install the framework via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/investing-algorithm-framework/):

1. First install the framework using `pip`. The Investing Algorithm Framework is hosted on [PyPi].

```bash
pip install investing-algorithm-framework
```

Run the following command to set up your project:

```bash
investing-algorithm-framewor init
```

For a web-enabled version:

```bash
investing-algorithm-framework init --web
```

This will create:

* app.py: The entry point for your bot.
* strategy.py: A sample strategy file to get started.

> Note: Keep the app.py file as is. You can modify strategy.py and add additional files to build your bot.
> You can always change the app to the web version by changing the `app.py` file.

---

## üìà Example: A Simple Trading Bot
The following example trading bot implements a simple moving average strategy.
The strategy will use data from bitvavo exchange and will calculate 
the 20, 50 and 100 period exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 
14 period relative strength index (RSI).

> This example uses [PyIndicators](https://github.com/coding-kitties/pyindicators) for technical analysis.
> This dependency is not part of the framework, but is used to perform technical analysis on the dataframes.
> You can install it using pip: pip install pyindicators.

```python
import logging.config
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from pyindicators import ema, rsi, crossunder, crossover, is_above

from investing_algorithm_framework import create_app, TimeUnit, Context, BacktestDateRange, \
    DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG, TradingStrategy, SnapshotInterval, BacktestReport, DataSource

app = create_app()
# Registered bitvavo market, credentials are read from .env file by default
app.add_market(market="BITVAVO", trading_symbol="EUR", initial_balance=100)

class MyStrategy(TradingStrategy):
    interval = 2
    time_unit = TimeUnit.HOUR
    data_sources = [
        DataSource(data_type="OHLCV", market="bitvavo", symbol="BTC/EUR", window_size=200, time_frame="2h", identifier="BTC-ohlcv", pandas=True),
    ]
    symbols = ["BTC/EUR"]

    def run_strategy(self, context: Context, data):

        if context.has_open_orders(target_symbol="BTC"):

            return

        data = data["BTC-ohlcv"]
        data = ema(data, source_column="Close", period=20, result_column="ema_20")

        data = rsi(data, source_column="Close", period=14, result_column="rsi_14")

        if context.has_position("BTC") and self.sell_signal(data):
            context.create_limit_sell_order(
                "BTC", percentage_of_position=100, price=data["Close"].iloc[-1]
            )
            return

        if not context.has_position("BTC") and self.buy_signal(data):
            context.create_limit_buy_order(
                "BTC", percentage_of_portfolio=20, price=data["Close"].iloc[-1]
            )
            return

    def buy_signal(self, data) -> bool:
        return False

    def sell_signal(self, data) -> bool:
        return False

date_range = BacktestDateRange(
    start_date="2023-08-24 00:00:00", end_date="2023-12-02 00:00:00"
)
app.add_strategy(MyStrategy)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the backtest with a daily snapshot interval for end-of-day granular reporting
    backtest = app.run_backtest(
        backtest_date_range=date_range, initial_amount=100, snapshot_interval=SnapshotInterval.DAILY
    )
    backtest_report = BacktestReport(backtests=[backtest])
    backtest_report.show()
```
